  <h3>History</h3>
  <p>Werda Holdings was founded early Year 16 as Werda Investments by the the Mandalorian trader Werda Mird. At Day 213 in Year 16 it was renamed to Werda Holdings and became publicly known outside Mandalore space when it registered as galaxy-wide operating company. A new trading organisation was born.</p>
  <p>Formerly specialised in the trading of valued assets like ships or stocks and investments, the company changed more and more it's buisness: After signing contracts with some of the most advanced R&D companies in small arms and personal gear markets, Werda Holdings maintained several factory cities to meet the demands of customers in this niche.</p>
  <p>Later on that same year, the company's leader was heavily wounded on an routine action to capture some bandits. Even though he tried to manage some of the buisness once he was out of the hospital and recovered, the profits of the company suffered heavily since there was no replacement for him. On Year 17, Day 78 Werda Holdings retired from Galactic Commerce Registry due to unprofitability and provided a closing-sale of the already produced goods over the final months.</p>
  <p>Now that Werda Mird is finally recovered, the company is looking ahead and hopes to become even bigger than before. A re-registration as a galaxy-wide company hasn't happened yet, but it's just a matter of time now that profits are growing again.</p>
