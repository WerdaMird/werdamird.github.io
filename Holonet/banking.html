  <li>Talk to Werda Mird and tell him how many credits you want to borrow (usually max. 50,000,000 at a time) and which Assets you have that you could provide as collateral and how long you think you need the credits for. We'll usually want something as collateral that is slightly more v valuable than the amount you want to borrow. But if you have a good reputation you can talk to us about anything.</li>
  <li>Depending on your details we'll offer you an Interest Rate and accept or decline the collateral for the requested amount. So you can either lower the amount or offer a higher value Collateral</li>
  <li>If agreed on the details you need to send the Collateral to Werda Mird. You'll still be assigned as Commander and can make regular use the assets used as collateral. As soon the collateral is received, you'll be sent the credits.</li>
  <li>You need to send at least the Interest Rate every Week. You're however free to pay off some of the Money additionally to lower Interest for next week or totally pay off the debt to receive back the collateral.</li>
  <li>If you fail to send the Interest Rate we'll first look to remove it from already payed off Money. If there is none, we'll unassign you and after 2 weeks, we'll sell the collateral if there is no contact from you.</li>
