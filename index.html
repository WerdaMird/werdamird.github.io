<h2 id="about">About us</h2>
  <h3>A Supplier of Smalls Arms</h3>
  <p>WERDA HOLDINGS or WH for short is known as one of the most famous and largest weapon industrialists in the entire galaxy. When a swift and reliable blaster is the only thing standing between you and a vile band of pirates, this is the shop to buy from.</p>
  <p>Werda Holdings offers one of the widest range of weapons and gear in the known galaxy. Choose from over 60 permanently available products. All of WHs products are cutting edge technology, boast an outstanding reliability as well as quality and come with a life-time guarantee. We deal with all political sides, freelancers, companies and governments</p>
  <p>Our engineers believe that achieving product excellence requires rising above our competitors by developing superior designs and manufacturing them with outstanding processes and excellent materials. Although the quality is exceptional the prices still aim at the lower end of the pricing scale.</p>
  "Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side." Unknown Smuggler
  <h3>History</h3>
  <p>Werda Holdings was founded early Year 16 as Werda Investments by the the Mandalorian Trader Werda Mird. At Day 213 in Year 16 it was renamed to Werda Holdings and became publicly known outside Mandalore Space when registered as Galaxy wide operating Company. A new Trading Organisation was born.</p>
  <p>Even former more specialised in the Trading of valued Assets like Ships or Stocks and Investments, the Company changed more and more it's Buisness: After signing Contracts with some of the most advanced R&D Companies in Small Arms and Personal Gear Area, Werda Holdings maintained several Factory Cities to meet the Demands of Customers in this Field</p>
  <p>Later on this year, the company's leader was heavily wounded on an routine action to capture some bandits. Even though he tried to manage some of the buisness once he was out of the hospital and recovered, the profits of the company suffered heavily since there was no replacement for him. On Year 17, Day 78 Werda Holdings retired from Galactic Commerce Registry due to unprofitability and just provided a closing-sale of the already produced goods over the final months.</p>
  <p>Now that Werda Mird is finally recovered, the company is looking ahead and hopes to become even bigger that before. A re-registration as a galaxy-wide company hasn't happened yet, but it's just a matter of time now that profits are growing again.</p>
